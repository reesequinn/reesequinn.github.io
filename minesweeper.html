            <h3>
                The assignment for this project was to re-create the classic logic puzzle game Minesweeper using C++ and SFML.
                If you aren't familiar with the game, you can play it online 
                <a href="https://minesweeperonline.com/">here</a>. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                We added a debug mode to make the development process easier. This mode draws the mines overtop of the tiles 
                and is enabled by clicking on the icon of the mine with the eye. We also added several test boards to allow
                for testing, particularly for ease in testing edge cases and replicating errors without having to use
                randomly generated boards.

            <h3>
                To create the GUI, we used Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). SFML is essentially a hardware 
                abstraction API. It allows the programmer to easily render assets using C++ library.

            <h3>
                The basic program structure is a two-dimensional array of tile objects. 
                Random.cpp was provided by the professor. It has a member variable random which is an instance 
                of the mt19937 class using the time as the seed. This class is part of the C++ standard library 
                and Mersenne Twister 19937 generator, a pseudo-random number generator that produces 32-bit numbers. 
                The class then uses uniform_int_distribution and uniform_real_distribution to transform the random 
                number into an integer or floating point number respectively within the specified range to be used 
                in the generation of the distribution of 50 mines.

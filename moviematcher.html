                The assignment for this project was to compare the performance of two data structures. I led a
                team of myself and two other classmates. Together we created this application to provide 
                information on movies and suggest movie titles based on genres and key words.

                To create the GUI, we used Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). SFML is essentially a hardware 
                abstraction API. It allows the programmer to easily render assets using C++ library. While SFML 
                is not geared toward this kind of project, this was only our second project that was not solely 
                command line. By creating our own assests, we were able to use technology we were already familiar 
                with from a previous project.

                We compared the two data structures below based on the time it took to retreive the seach results. 
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>
                        <b>Heap</b>: The slower data structure we used as a max heap ordered by ID. It was 
                        implemented using the priority_queue class in the C++ standard library. Its search 
                        has a time complexity of O(n).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Map</b>: The faster data structure we used was a map, using the C++ standard library 
                        map with the ID as the key. This map is usually implemented as a red-black tree, which has 
                        a search time complexity of O(logn).

# Reese's Resume Site

This is my personal website. It is still in development. It is statically hosted through GitHub Pages and the main branch can be viewed at [reesequinn.github.io](https://reesequinn.github.io/). 

I created this site to extend my learning outside of school, highlight my skills, and display past projects. It is being developed using HTML and CSS with potential for JavaScript features in the future. 

Pages for each project are under development, and as they are updated, they will be linked to the thumbnail images on the project page. Projects with a page published will show in color when moused over.
